# GitHub Repository - Array Operations

📁 This GitHub repository contains a JavaScript script file, `script.js`, which includes several functions for manipulating an array of employee objects. The goal is to perform various tasks using the `map` and `forEach` functions and update the array accordingly. Let's go through the functions and their respective tasks:

## Functions

### 1. `PrintDeveloperbyMap()`
🔍 This function utilizes the `map` function to print all the employees who have the profession of "developer." It iterates through the array of employee objects and outputs the relevant information using `console.log`.

### 2. `PrintDeveloperbyForEach()`
🔍 Similarly, this function utilizes the `forEach` function to achieve the same result. It iterates over the employee objects in the array and prints the information of those employees whose profession is "developer" using `console.log`.

### 3. `addData()`
✨ Within this function, a new employee object is created and appended to the existing array. The newly added employee has the following attributes: `id`, `name`, `age`, and `profession`. After appending the object to the array, the updated array is logged using `console.log`.

### 4. `removeAdmin()`
🔥 In this function, an employee object is removed from the array if their profession is "admin." After removing the object, the modified array is logged using `console.log`.

### 5. `ConcatenateArray()`
🔗 Here, a new array with three employee objects is created. Each object has different attributes, including a unique `id`. Then, the original array and the new array are concatenated together. The resulting merged array is logged using `console.log`.

## Cloning and Usage
📥 To use this repository, you can simply clone it to your local machine and edit the `script.js` file according to the requirements mentioned above. Make sure to save your changes and run the updated script.
